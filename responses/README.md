## Response comparisons between the original and finetuned models

For comparisons after finetuneing, the training questions were presented to both the original 
Llama3_1-8B-Instruct model and the finetuned Llama3_1-8B-Instruct-AMD-python model.  

These files conain the questions and responses from both models on questions that were used in the training data:

 Technology: train_1111_responses.csv  
Python code: train_547_python_code_responses.csv  

These files contain the questions and responses from test questions that were not used for training (finetuning):

 Technology: test_150_responses.csv  
Python code: test_60_python_code_responses.csv
